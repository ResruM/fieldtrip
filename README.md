# Omission Frontiers

## Synopsis
This project is intended for facilitating group-level analysis in magnetoencephalography (MEG) using the open toolboxes MNE-Python and FieldTrip. The code is accompanied by an article for each of the toolboxes in an upcoming Frontiers Special Issue.  
Intended to be compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.x, but hasn't been extensively tested for Python 3

## Motivation
Most tutorials on MEG analysis are at the single-subject level. This is an attempt at remedying that situation by providing a comphehensive collection of functions that can all be accessed from a single pipeline script (MNE-Python) or several pipeline scripts (FieldTrip)

## Installation
No installation is required. Simply download the scripts and get the data at the following DOI:10.5281/zenodo.998518 or URL:https://zenodo.org/record/998518
